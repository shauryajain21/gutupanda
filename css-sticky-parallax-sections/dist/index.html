      <p>So we have been friends for three years. I feel the luckiest person Alive to have such a best friend who is there with me with so many Ups and downs. At this point I care so much about our friendship, I wouldn’t let anything, (even that punk ass martian bitches who are up with their ufos’s coming to pick me up & obviously Khushi) thwart it.</p>
   <p>Have you ever thought how the fuck two persons of such different wavelength can be such close friends. It’s been a million hours talking to you and I don’t know how, whenever I am free, you are the first person I ping to. It feels right when I am with you — on phone, on text or rarely in front. I don’t know how do I get bored with someone after talking to them for a few minute or so but not with you even after talking to you for years and years. You are one of the few thing I value and I only see that value increasing anytime ever.</p>
   <p>We might separate in future or we might become even better friends, but for the past few years you are the best company I could ever deserve. I feel a plethora of emotions while writing this. I can hear some conversations in my head, some texts floating around my eyes, experience some of our future plans happening but I still can’t remember or imagine a day in my life where you aren’t there dum dum.</p>
